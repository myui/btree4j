# What's Btree4j

Btree4j is a disk-based [Prefix B+-tree](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=320530) written in Pure Java.

It's pretty fast and [100k ops/sec](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/blob/master/src/test/java/btree4j/benchmark/JMHBenchmark.java) is expected even on laptop.

# Using btree4j

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.myui</groupId>
    <artifactId>btree4j</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.1</version>
</dependency>
```

[Find usage](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/tree/master/src/test/java/btree4j) in unit tests.

# Features and Strength

Applied many improvements over the original Xindice's implementation as follows:

* Implementes [Prefix B+-tree](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=320530) in which prefixes are selected carefully to minimize their length. In prefix B+-tree, key prefixes are managed by a [TRIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)-like smart algorithm.

* Pointers are [compressed](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/blob/master/src/main/java/btree4j/utils/codec/VariableByteCodec.java) using [Variable Byte Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_code) so that more keys/values are fit in memory.

* Support both unique and non-unique indexing. Storing duplicate keys is allowed for non-unique indexing.

* [Index file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_file) based on B+-tree is [supported](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/blob/master/src/main/java/btree4j/BTreeIndex.java). [Multiple values per a key](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/blob/master/src/main/java/btree4j/BTreeIndexDup.java) is also supported.
 [BTreeIndex](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/blob/master/src/main/java/btree4j/BTreeIndex.java) stores `<bytes[] KEY, byte[] VALUE>` with VALUE stored on distinct data pages and pointers to them are managed by [B+-Tree](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/blob/master/src/main/java/btree4j/BTree.java) to avoid consuming many disk pages for large values in B+-tree.

* Support variable-length [key](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/blob/master/src/main/java/btree4j/Key.java)/[value](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/blob/master/src/main/java/btree4j/Value.java)

* [Prefix and range search](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/blob/master/src/main/java/btree4j/indexer/BasicIndexQuery.java) is supported in addition to exact match using a [flexible callback handler](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/blob/master/src/main/java/btree4j/BTreeCallback.java). Support [LIKE match](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/blob/master/src/main/java/btree4j/indexer/LikeIndexQuery.java) using wildcards.

* Paging (virtual memory) support using [LRU cache replacement policy](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/blob/master/src/main/java/btree4j/BTree.java) and [Freespace management](https://github.com/myui/btree4j/blob/master/src/main/java/btree4j/FreeList.java).

* Deletion and updates are, of course, supported.

* Support efficient Bulk-loading.

* Minimum dependencies to external libraries. Runs on Java 8 or later.
